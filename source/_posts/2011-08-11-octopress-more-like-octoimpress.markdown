I've had a blog over at [Alligator Dodgeball](http://www.brigom.com/) for a while. I have my own 
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) installation, and the friendly user interface makes it easy 
to write a post, edit a post, monitor comments. It's fun.

But, I'm trying something new with this one. I call it Brigh.am Writes (or maybe Brigham 
Writes. Am I the only one who thinks owning the brigh.am domain is, well, cool?) It will be a lot about
programming, but hopefully also about books, movies, running, and maybe a little about married life.

If you scroll down to the bottom of this page, you'll see a little tag that says "Powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org)."
There are a few differences between Octopress and Wordpress, besides the cute animal logo.

<!--more-->

1. Octopress is a static blog. Each page is generated once. Wordpress is a dynamically generated blog.
The pages are generated every time someone looks at the blog. That's the main difference and underlies
the rest of the differences.
2. Octopress is cheaper to own. My [web host](htts://www.nearlyfreespeech.net "Nearly Free Speech") charges
1&#162; a day for dynamically generated web sites, whether someone looks at it or not. If someone looks at it,
they charge for the bandwidth. For a static site, they only charge for the storage and the bandwidth.
3. Wordpress uses a database to store posts and comments. I have to maintain the database, and if I ever
write a post that gets a lot of traffic, it's possible that the database won't be able to keep up. Also,
the servers have to piece together the HTML for every page view. With a static site, the files are
pregenerated, so the web server only has to identify the file the reader is looking for and send it.
No database needed.
4. Also, no database means that the bare posts are stored in regular files on my hard drive. It means I can
work on a blog post in a plane or anywhere.
5. Wordpress requires constant updates, which I really shouldn't ignore, but too frequently I do. There have
been a lot of security flaws discovered in the past few months, and letting the software fall behind means I
could get hacked.
6. Of course, there are some disadvantages. Octopress doesn't have a pretty post editor.
7. Wordpress supports comments all by itself. Octopress doesn't have comments all on its own. I have to use a 
[separate service](http://disqus.com "Disqus") to manage my comments. So, in a way, I'm giving up some of the
control over my blog.
8. Octopress will be more work.

I also want to try some other things with this site, including writing a few games.
